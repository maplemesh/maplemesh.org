### Our Goal: _Resilient Radio, Connected Community_

We want to help our community stay connected. MapleMesh is a volunteer effort to build a local network across Covington, Maple Valley, Hobart, and nearby areas so neighbors can reach each other, even if phone or internet service goes down.


### Why MapleMesh?

Because connection matters. MapleMesh is about more than technology — it’s about neighbors helping neighbors. By joining, you’re strengthening our community and creating a simple, reliable way to stay in touch.

### How Do I Get Started?

It’s easier than you think! You don’t need to have a technology background to join in. Visit our **Get Started** guide (pending) and we’ll walk you through it. Whether you set up your own small device or just spread the word, every step helps the network grow.
