MapleMesh East Covington (`MECV`) is now online! It helps to bridge to the western nodes like Covington (`MMCV`) and another good path to Winterwood (`MMWW`).

From a coverage standpoint, it should give some coverage to the downtown part of Covington and a path to get some nodes in the downtown area to fill that in.

If you live or work in or near downtown Covington, feel free to reach out to us via Discord or [email](mailto:admin@maplemesh.org).

Expected coverage:
