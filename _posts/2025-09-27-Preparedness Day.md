We now have a logo, motto, and web presence for MapleMesh!

Most of the team attended the preparedness day at Maple Valley Farmer's Market on Saturday and we made some good connections with local emergency support groups like [VERRT](https://www.facebook.com/groups/greatermvcert/) and [Puget Sound Fire Communications Support](https://pugetsoundfire.org/emergency-management/communications-support-team-ham-radio/).
